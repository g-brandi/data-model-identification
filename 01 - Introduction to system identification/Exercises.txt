1) Repeat the identification process with other model families (for example
changing the order of the ARX model or using the commands bj, oe, ie, armax).

2) Repeat the identification process using wider segments of data.

3) Evaluate the adherence of the found models to the validation set.

4) Repeat the whiteness analysis considering the unused dataset data2.
