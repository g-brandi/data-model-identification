Consider Part 1.

1) Repeat the script considering the variance of the noise equal to 1e-5.
Check if the adherence of the wrong model and of the m100 model are similar.

2) Considering the variance of the noise equal to 1e-5, compute the
cross-correlation of the wrong model.

3) Repeat the script identifying the system with an ARX model, using U as
input and the prediction error as ouput. In other words, perform the 
so-called Model Error Identification.



Consider Part 2 and Part 3.

1) Repeat the script considering the variance of the noise equal to 1e-5.
What happens to the cross-correlation of the model m500 and why this happens?

2) Compute the parametric error on matrices A and B

3) Repeat the script using ARMAX family. What happens to the parametric
errors of matrices A and B and why this happens?

4) Repeat the script using ARMAX family. Compute the parametric error of
matrix C. Comment its behaviour and compare it to the behaviours of the
parametric errors of matrices A and B.
