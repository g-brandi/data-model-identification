1) Repeat the script by choosing an aprbs(500,10,80,-4,4) input signal.
Explain the obtained results.

2) Repeat the script by changing the interval of the piecewise linear
input signal to [-6:1.2:6]. Explain the obtained results.

3) Repeat the script considering a faster dynamic of the non-linear system.
